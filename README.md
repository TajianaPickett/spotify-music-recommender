# Music Recommendation System

A Python-based project that recommends songs with similar moods and styles using Spotify audio features.  
This project applies data analysis and machine learning to understand how energy, valence, and acoustic features shape a song’s vibe.

## Project Overview
**Goal:** Build a content-based recommender that suggests similar songs.  
**Data:** Spotify Audio Features Dataset (tracks, genres, and year).  
**Techniques:** Feature scaling, K-Means clustering, cosine similarity, and t-SNE visualization.  
**Key Features:**  
- Analyzes energy, danceability, valence, and loudness correlations.  
- Clusters songs and genres by mood and sound.  
- Returns top song recommendations based on feature similarity.
