### Project Overview
This project explores how machine learning can enhance music recommendation by grouping songs based on their audio characteristics.  
Using **K-Means clustering** with **dimensionality reduction (PCA and t-SNE)**, I identified patterns among tracks in the Spotify dataset and visualized them in **Tableau**.

The goal was to understand how data can capture aspects of **musical similarity** that listeners experience intuitively.
