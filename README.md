# spotify-music-recommender
A machine learning project that recommends songs based on audio feature similarity using K-Means clustering, PCA, and t-SNE.
This project explores how machine learning can enhance music recommendation by grouping songs based on their audio characteristics. Using K-Means clustering with dimensionality reduction (PCA and t-SNE), I identified patterns among tracks in the Spotify dataset and visualized them in Tableau. The goal was to understand how data can capture aspects of musical similarity that listeners experience intuitively.
